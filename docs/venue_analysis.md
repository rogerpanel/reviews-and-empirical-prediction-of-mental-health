# Venue targeting and alignment with the review's categorisation

*Prepared 2026-09-05. Journal metrics quoted here were taken from public indexing pages found by
web search on that date and must be re-verified in JCR / Scopus before submission; they change every
June.*

## 1. What each paper is, in the eyes of an editor

| | Paper A | Paper B |
|---|---|---|
| Article type | Systematic review with critical appraisal (PRISMA 2020; PROBAST+AI; TRIPOD+AI) | Prediction-model methods study / empirical demonstration (TRIPOD+AI as author) |
| Primary claim | The ML-for-mental-health literature is methodologically unsound and incompletely reported in specific, quantifiable ways | Those specific failures cost a measurable amount of discrimination and calibration on real, public data |
| Reader | Methodologists, editors, reviewers, clinical-AI developers | ML-for-health practitioners, digital-phenotyping researchers |
| Reporting checklist the venue will demand | PRISMA 2020 (+ PROSPERO ID) | TRIPOD+AI checklist as a supplement |

## 2. Candidate venues

Fit is judged on (a) whether the journal has published PROBAST/TRIPOD-style appraisals or
validation-methodology studies before, (b) whether the mental-health readership is reached,
(c) selectivity relative to the likely strength of the result, and (d) open-access cost.

### Paper A (review + appraisal)

| Rank | Venue | Why it fits | Risk / cost | Evidence of precedent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **npj Digital Medicine** (Nature Portfolio; IF ~18 per 2026 listing) | Publishes systematic reviews with PROBAST critical appraisal of ML models; digital-health methods critique is core scope; high visibility for a "state of the field" paper | Very selective; needs the full 80-200 study yield and PROBAST+AI (2025) applied, not legacy PROBAST; APC | "Machine learning in vascular surgery: a systematic review and critical appraisal" (npj Digit Med 2021) |
| 2 | **JMIR Mental Health** (IF ~7.4, Q1 Psychiatry) | Exact readership; publishes methodological reviews of digital mental-health AI; fast; accepts long supplements (extraction tables) | APC; less methodological prestige than 1 | Frequent ML-for-mental-health reviews; JMIR family publishes TRIPOD-adherence audits |
| 3 | **Journal of Clinical Epidemiology** (Elsevier; Q1) | Home journal of the PROBAST/TRIPOD community; the natural venue if the paper's centre of gravity is the appraisal instrument (PROBAST+AI first use at breadth, EPV >= 200 finding) | Readers are methodologists, not psychiatrists; mental-health framing becomes secondary | Andaur Navarro et al. (BMJ 2021) and Dhiman et al. (J Clin Epidemiol 2022) ML-appraisal reviews |
| 4 | **Molecular Psychiatry** / **Translational Psychiatry** | Meehan et al. 2022 (308 psychiatric prediction models; 22.1 % reported calibration) set the precedent there | Meehan is also the closest prior work; the paper must show what it adds (ML/digital modalities, PROBAST+AI, leakage outcome, EPV >= 200) | Meehan 2022; "Generalizability of clinical prediction models in mental health" (Mol Psychiatry 2025) |
| 5 | **Journal of Biomedical Informatics** (brief's primary; 2026 listing shows IF 5.9, **Q2**) | Methodological informatics; would accept; good for Paper B pairing | Lower quartile than the brief assumed; weaker mental-health readership | Regularly publishes ML validation methodology |
| 6 | International Journal of Medical Informatics (IF ~5.0, Q1) | Safe Q1 fallback | Less visible | — |

**Recommendation for A.** Target npj Digital Medicine if the search yields >= 100 included studies
and PROBAST+AI is used; otherwise JMIR Mental Health. Keep J Clin Epidemiol as the methodological
fallback. Do not send to JBI first: for a review, a Q2 informatics venue under-sells the work.

### Paper B (empirical companion)

| Rank | Venue | Why it fits | Risk / cost | Evidence of precedent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **JMIR AI** | Published "Participant-Aware Model Validation for Repeated-Measures Data: Comparative Cross-Validation Study" (2026), i.e. exactly the E1 question in another domain; welcomes calibration and validation-methodology papers | Young journal (indexing still maturing) | JMIR AI 2026;e87728 |
| 2 | **IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics** (Q1) | Wearable/actigraphy ML readership; the Simula cohorts are well known there; methodological rigour valued | Long review times; needs strong engineering presentation | HYPERAKTIV / PSYKOSE follow-ups appear in IEEE venues |
| 3 | **Journal of Biomedical Informatics** | Methods-oriented; comfortable with "negative"/cautionary empirical results; pairs with A if A goes elsewhere | Q2 per 2026 listing | — |
| 4 | **npj Digital Medicine** (brief research / short communication) | If E1-E3 effect sizes are large and clean, a short paper here alongside A in the same journal is the highest-impact pairing | Selectivity; APC x2 | — |
| 5 | Computers in Biology and Medicine (IF ~8.4) / Artificial Intelligence in Medicine | Accept broad ML-in-medicine work; CBM's IF is high but its scope is engineering-general | Reviewer pool less attuned to PROBAST/TRIPOD framing | — |

**Recommendation for B.** JMIR AI first (fastest route to a venue that has already validated the
question), IEEE JBHI second. Submit B only after A is at least under review with a preprint DOI
(medRxiv for A, arXiv cs.LG or medRxiv for B) so the cross-citation is verifiable.

## 3. Alignment matrix: review outcome -> appraisal item -> experiment -> code -> test

This is the "categorisation and directions" the user asked to be honoured: every primary outcome
of Paper A maps onto one PROBAST(+AI) signalling question, one TRIPOD+AI item, one Paper B
experiment, one code module and one test that enforces it.

| Paper A primary outcome | PROBAST(+AI) | TRIPOD+AI item (workbook numbering) | Paper B experiment | Code | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Any external validation performed | 4.8 (optimism), applicability | 10e, 24 | **E2** train-on-A / test-on-B, no refitting | `evaluation/external.py` | `assert_cohorts_disjoint` + `test_external_runner_refuses_overlapping_subjects` |
| Calibration reported | 4.7 (both calibration AND discrimination) | 12, 24 | **E3** slope, intercept, Brier, ECE, reliability curves for every model | `evaluation/metrics.py` | `test_metrics.py` (slope/intercept recover known miscalibration) |
| AUROC rather than accuracy alone | 4.7 | 12 | all: AUROC, AUPRC, macro-F1, MCC alongside accuracy | `evaluation/metrics.py` | `test_binary_metrics_keys_and_ranges` |
| Leakage-prone evaluation design (record-wise splitting of repeated measures) | 4.8; PROBAST+AI data-leakage question | 10d, 11 | **E1** record-wise vs subject-wise, paired difference | `evaluation/splitters.py` | `test_no_subject_leakage.py` (fails the build for any non-E1 config using `record_wise`) |
| EPV >= 200 expectation for ML | 4.1 | 8 | reported per cohort in the E2 table (`epv` column) | `experiments._epv` | — (reported, not enforced) |
| Class prevalence reported | 1.2 / 3.4 | 22 | prevalence in every metrics row (`prevalence`) | `metrics.binary_metrics` | — |
| Resampling inside CV folds | 4.8 | 11 | SMOTE optional, imblearn Pipeline only | `models/pipelines.py` | `test_pipeline_fit_order.py` |
| Code / data availability | — | 19, 20 | this repository; `data/README.md`; manifests with git SHA and checksums | `reporting/manifest.py` | — |
| Near-perfect performance as leakage case studies | 4.8 | 24 | E1 inflation size is the empirical counterpart | `experiments.run_e1` | paired subject bootstrap |
| Uncertainty intervals | 4.8 | 24 | subject-level BCa bootstrap | `evaluation/bootstrap.py` | `test_subject_bootstrap_resamples_subjects_not_windows` |

Two directions in the workbook are **not** covered by the code and must be handled in the manuscript
text: TRIPOD+AI item 14/25 (fairness by subgroup; sex is available for DEPRESJON, PSYKOSE, HYPERAKTIV
and can be added as a stratified analysis) and item 18 (pre-registration; an OSF registration of the
E1-E3 analysis plan before the real data is run is strongly recommended and cheap).

## 4. Consequences for the manuscripts' structure

* Paper A follows PRISMA 2020 section order; the appraisal results are organised **by outcome**
  (the six primary outcomes above), not by study, and each outcome section ends with one sentence
  pointing to the Paper B experiment that quantifies its cost.
* Paper B follows TRIPOD+AI section order; Methods are organised **by experiment** (E1-E3) and each
  experiment opens with the Paper A proportion it responds to.
* Both papers share one figure concept: "prevalence of the practice in the literature (A)" beside
  "cost of the practice on data (B)".

## 5. Update (15 Sept 2026): APC-free Elsevier targets and the integrated option

The author prefers venues without an article processing charge. Elsevier hybrid journals publish
subscription articles at no cost to the author (open access is optional and paid). Verified on
public journal pages:

| Venue | Model | Fit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Artificial Intelligence in Medicine** (Elsevier) | Hybrid; ~31 % gold OA, subscription route free | Best fit for the integrated paper and for Paper B: AI methods applied in medicine, methodological rigour valued, publishes systematic reviews with appraisal | Q1 (Scimago: AI, Medicine misc.) |
| Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine (Elsevier) | Hybrid; APC USD 3,180 only if OA chosen; subscription route free | Methods/software in biomedicine; Q1 in Computer Science Applications, Health Informatics, Software | Good second choice |
| International Journal of Medical Informatics (Elsevier) | Hybrid | Q1; informatics readership | Third |
| Journal of Biomedical Informatics (Elsevier) | Hybrid | Q2 in 2026 listing | Fallback |
| Computers in Biology and Medicine (Elsevier) | Charges an APC for OA; check current model before submitting | Broad | Avoid if APC-free is a requirement |
| IEEE JBHI | Hybrid (no fee for traditional publication) | Wearables/health ML | Non-Elsevier alternative |

**Integrated paper.** A single manuscript combining a *closed-scope* systematic appraisal (every
published model on DEPRESJON/PSYKOSE/HYPERAKTIV/OBF-Psychiatric) with the empirical re-evaluation
on the same cohorts is stronger than either half alone and is completable: the review scope is
citation-closed (tens of papers, not thousands), and each appraisal outcome is priced on the same
data. Draft: `paper/integrated/manuscript_AB.tex`. The field-wide review (Paper A) remains a
separate, later paper. Recommended: submit the integrated paper to Artificial Intelligence in
Medicine.
